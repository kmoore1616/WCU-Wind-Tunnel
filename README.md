## Overview of System

This document describes the functioning of the WCU Wind Tunnel. This
system is capable\
of up to 70m/s (Â 160 mph) and has a $Xm^3$ test section. It can gather
data on lift,\
drag, and stall characteristics of models tested, and can serve as an
excellent\
educational aid, and may be useful in advancing various forms of
aerodynamic research.

## Quick Start Guide

While it is recommended that the user read the [User
Guide](#sec:user_guide) in its entirety, this section\
can be used to quickly understand the basic operation of the system. To
get data\
quickly, the following steps can be used to safely start and operate the
system.

## Hardware Guide

The electrical system for the wind tunnel consists of a central hub
called the [CAB](#sec:nomenclature) that interfaces\
with a suite of sensors and the VFD that allows the operation of the
system. This section\
will describe each subsystem in detail.\

**CAB Overview**
:::

The central part of the CAB is the
[DAQ](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/daq-getting-started-bus-powered-usb/page/getting-started.html).
This device acts as the firmware between the sensors\
and LabVIEW. There are three modules used to do this. The
[NI-9239](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/model/ni-9239.html) analog input
module,\
that acts basically as a multimeter. It has a positive and negative
terminal per channel.\
The [NI-9219](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/model/ni-9219.html). Which
is similar to the 9239, having additional functionality for load cell
sensors.\
The [NI-9263](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/model/ni-9263.html) analog
output module that is used to throttle the VFD, akin to a programmable
power-supply. [Below](#sec:figs) is an annotated image of the DAQ, and
its associated hardware.

**DAQ Hardware Description**
:::

As stated above, the brain of this system is the DAQ. This device and
its modules acts essentially like a combined multimeter and power
supply. It uses these capabilities to monitor and control each
individual subsystem. The 9239 module has 2 terminals per channel,
labeled 0-1, where 0 is the positive terminal and 1 the negative
terminal.\
**Pressure Transmitters**: To read the [pressure
transmitters](https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/shopping/catalog/process_control_-a-_measurement/pressure_sensors/pressure_transmitters/lppt25-20-v30h)
this module is required to read in the current outputted from the
device, 4-20ma, mapping to -14.7 to 30PSIG. (Note that PSIG reads the
relative pressure against ambient room pressure). To accomplish this,
shunt resistors of $220\ohm$ are used, and a conversion ma = V/220 \*
1000 is done in software. Attached [Below](#sec:figs) is a schematic of
the pressure transmitter read circuit.\
**VFD Frequency In**: In addition to reading the pressure transmitters,
the DAQ is responsible for reading in frequency data from the VFD on the
9239 using voltage. The VFD can output this information via AO1 (See
[VFD](#sec:VFD)), in a percentage from $0-10V$. This voltage is then
multiplied by six in software and outputted as a frequency, giving the
user a useful sanity checker and debug tool.\
**VFD Frequency Out**: The DAQ is also capable of outputting a desired
voltage via the NI-9263. This is used to send voltage commands to the
VFD via AI0 (See [VFD](#sec:VFD)) from 0-10v mapping to 0-60hz. The user
can either select the option to set a desired percentage of max fan
speed (useful for when the system lacks pitot tube readings). There is
also an option to set a PID controlled velocity setting (see \*TODO
SOFTWARE DOCS\*).\
**Sting**: The sting currently is manually operated with a level, with
three load cells leading into the NI-9219 module, providing useful
information to derive lift, drag, and moment. Schematics of this are
[Below](#sec:figs). **VFD**\
[]{#sec:VFD label="sec:VFD"} The VFD or Variable Frequency Driver is the
throttle for the wind tunnel. It is located on the fan inside the box
with the dials and switches above the power switch. This box takes a
signal from a potentiometer, either physical or emulated, from $0-10v$,
and uses this to throttle the fan from $0-100\%$ power. There is a big
red emergency stop button that will quickly spin the fan down, an on off
switch, a potentiometer dial, as well as a switch between \"AUTOMATED\"
and \"MANUAL\" modes. If switched to MANUAL, the VFD will use the
potentiometer physically attached to the box as a throttle. In this
mode, there should be an operator at the box at all times to both
throttle the fan as well as to monitor the frequency the VFD is
currently running at for accuracy. MANUAL mode should only be used if
the AUTOMATED mode is not accessible for whatever reason. The AUTOMATED
mode uses the controls within LabVIEW to send a voltage $0-10v$ directly
into the VFD. The user can specify either a frequency ($0-60hz$) or a
desired airspeed ($0-70m/s$) and the fan will spin up.

## Programming Guide

**Labview**\
[]{#sec:LbVw label="sec:LbVw"} The majority of the functionality of this
system is run in a program called LabVIEW. This program is a little
cumbersome for anybody with any experience with a traditional
programming language, yet was chosen for its ease of entry for a slew of
engineers with limited programming knowledge. This section will strive
to understand the web of code that is the [VI](#sec:nomenclature).\
**Descriptions and Tool-tips**\
Before I get into detail on the functionality of the VI, note that
(most) parts of said VI contain a tool-tip briefly explaining their
functionality. These can be accessed via the \"Help-Context Help\" tab
on the left side of the toolbar. Clicking on parts of the VI will show a
developer comment on the component as well as a hyperlink to the
relevant link on LabVIEW's documentation. **Main Program Loop**\
The Wind Tunnel Main VI is (mostly) encapsulated in a while loop. In the
VI this consists of a gray box that surrounds most of the components.
Everything outside of this loop is ran once on program start, while
everything inside is ran throughout the execution of the program. If you
are familiar with Arduino you can think of the outside being \"void
Setup()\" and the insides being \"void loop()\".\
**Shift Registers**\
Along the border of the while loops are boxes with a downward facing
arrow inside. These components are called [Shift
Registers](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA03q000000YKYuCAO&l=en-US)
and are similar to global variables. During setup, these can be set to a
base value. During the execution of the program, the previous data
stored is outputted from the left terminal and the right terminal is an
input to store the next value. This is seen in the program with the
\"Tare SR's\". There is a boolean controlled by the user that tells the
vi to set the value of the shift register to be changed to the current
value of the sensor, otherwise it keeps the previous tare. The value of
the SR is then subtracted from the unadjusted value read in from the
sensors.\
**DAQ**\
The
[DAQ](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/measurement-studio-ni-daqmx-projects-for-.net-4.5.1/page/netdaqasst.html)
is the tool used by the VI in order to read in raw data from the various
sensors and VFD, as well as to output a control voltage to the VFD. The
**DAQ Input** component contains the settings for data collection.
Double clicking on it will bring up a menu that lists different channels
among other information. Each channel is an input from an individual DAQ
module, and is outputted as a dynamic signal. This dynamic signal is an
array with additional metadata attached. In the VI, this dynamic signal
(blue line) is split into two paths. One that is stripped of this
metadata and broken up into its individual parts for more data
processing. The other is passed directly into a spreadsheet for raw data
collection. The **DAQ Output** is interfaced in the same way as the DAQ
Input, it however, controls the output modules.
